Introduction
============

PyLogo is a Logo interpreter written in Python.  Its implementation is
small, and is based on the language as implemented by UCBLogo_.  The
Logo language is a learning language, intended for children for which
more "complete" languages aren't appropriate.  Many of Logos language
design choices are driven by this, and differ from Python.

.. _UCBLogo: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html

Because of the design choices a Logo compiler (or translator) is
difficult to write -- aspects of the parsing can only be done at
runtime.  So PyLogo is an interpreter built on top of another
interpreter.  So it's not that fast, but it's not so bad either.
(Some Logo implementations have been faster, like StarLogo or Object
Logo, by using complex optimizations and lazy compilation, and of
course an interpreter written in C would be faster)

Logo is a simple an elegent language.  Its focused much more on
mathematics, abstract thought, and accessibility than on software
design; Mindstorms_ by Seymour Papert is a good introduction to the
philosophy.  Since many people in the Python community have had
aspirations for using Python for these goals, Logo seems like an
interesting example upon which to think about learning and
programming.

.. _Mindstorms: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465046746/qid=1067922418/sr=ka-2/ref=pd_ka_2/002-8146556-2968008

I feel programming environments have a widely untapped potential to
revolutionize pre-algebra mathematical learning, and abstraction
skills in general.  What is challenging in the declarative expressions
of algebra is easy and intuitive when using imperative programming
with names and values.  (Boxer_ is even *more* concrete, but that's a
task for another day)

.. _Boxer: http://www.soe.berkeley.edu/boxer/

Python, while elegant in many ways, does not have the simplicity of
Logo, or the casual syntax to make it accessible to absolute
beginners, who often don't have the keyboarding skills to write proper
Python code, the typographic literacy to identify the detailed
punctuation used, and lack the patience to build these skills before
producing working programs.

Despite these general goals, PyLogo also offers some practical
advantages.  One of PyLogo's best features is the ease of using Python
code from PyLogo code (and to a lesser degree, vice versa).  Logo
primitives are easy to add.  PyGame_ primitives would be be very
interesting.

Features
========

* Complete Logo language, based on the UCBLogo dialect.
* Errors produce tracebacks of your Logo code.
* Multi-threaded.
* Multiple simultaneous turtles (unfortunately not yet compatible with
  threading).
* Easily extensible from Python.
* Written 100% in Python (portable, easy to read, etc).

Anti-Features
-------------

* Still early in development.
* A lot of erroneous, or even syntactically incorrect Logo will create
  weird error messages, instead of causing error messages like it
  should.
* Python errors aren't handled too elegantly -- they get wrapped in a
  special ``LogoError`` which creates the Logo traceback (which you
  want), but this can obscure as well as assist.  Python tracebacks
  and Logo tracebacks don't quite go together.
* Not very fast.  A tight loop is about 400x lower than Python, about
  10x slower than UCBLogo.  
* No IDE.  No persistence (mmm, pickle_), for storing code or
  incomplete projects.  None of that clever stuff that the commercial
  Logos have.  But maybe someday...
* No quasi-quote.

Usage
=====

PyLogo's basic syntax is very similar to UCBLogo_.  You may wish to
read the `UCBLogo manual`_ -- many of the primitives in UCBLogo are
implemented in PyLogo (in the ``builtins.py`` module).

.. _`UCBLogo manual`: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/usermanual

Basic usage::

    $ python setup.py install
    ...
    $ pylogo
    Importing pylogo.builtins
    ??? 1 + 1
    2
    ??? to square :size
    to?   repeat 4 [
    to?     fd :size
    to?     rt 90
    to?   ]
    to? end
    Function: square
    ??? square 100

Compared to UCBLogo
===================

I've also included a `post about Logo`__, which is a useful description
for people knowledgeable about computer programming languages.

.. __: LogoLanguage.html

Language Differences
--------------------

MAKE accepts UCBLogo's form (``MAKE "var 10``) and a more normal, less
surprising form (``MAKE :var 10``).  LOCAL works the same way.

FOR works more like Pythons ``for``, e.g. ``FOR :i :some_sequence
[block]``.  It is a special form (hence ``:i`` instead of ``"i``).
UCBLogo's FOR is more like Pascal (``FOR [i start end step]
[block]``).

PyLogo doesn't have constrained object types.  Variables can hold any
kind of object.  Because of this many of UCBLogo's awkard constructs
-- like properties and files -- can be implemented as normal objects
(in UCBLogo properties and files get names, and are referred to by
these names -- essentially each object type has its own global
namespace and is addressable only by name).

PyLogo doesn't distinguish between procedures and functions, i.e., you
do not have to use ``IGNORE`` to suppress an error when you ignore the
result of a function.  All procedures return None, like in Python.

Python dictionaries can be used in PyLogo.  ``NEWDICT`` creates a new
dictionary, and ``ITEM`` and ``SETITEM`` can be used (like ``ITEM :key
:dict`` or ``SETITEM :key :dict :value``).  You can use the ``KEYS``,
``VALUES``, and ``ITEMS`` functions to access the appropriate methods
on dictionaries.

The special Python variables None, True, and False are available with
the (zero-argument) functions ``NONE``, ``TRUE``, and ``FALSE``.

Logo files can be loaded with the ``LOAD`` command.  You do not need
to use the ``.logo`` extension with the name.  Python modules can also
be loaded, if they are in the current directory.  Python modules can
be loaded from other locations using the ``IMPORT`` statement, like
``IMPORT [path to my module]`` to load ``path.to.my.module``.

Scoping is slightly different than in most Logos.  Barring the use of
``LOCAL``, when you do something like ``MAKE :VAR 10``, we look for a
scope where ``:VAR`` is defined; if found we change that binding.  If
it is not found, we set it in the local scope.  Many Logos set it in
the global scope.

Turtles and Graphics
--------------------

Graphics are implemented in the ``logo_turtle.py`` module, which is in
turn built upon the standard Python ``turtle`` module.  Most basic
commands match UCBLogo, and are typical for most Logos.  

Minor differences:

``PENCOLOR`` can take a color name (like "white), or used like
``(PENCOLOR 255 255 0)`` to set RGB colors exactly.

``HIDETURTLE`` (or ``HT``) speeds up graphics a lot.  It usually does
in Logo implementations, but there's a larger delay in actions in the
Python ``turtle`` module than is typical elsewhere.

``TURTLEWRITE`` will write text at the turtle's current position.  Use
lists for multiple words.  ``(TURTLEWRITE [text] 1)`` will also move
the turtle to the end of the text (otherwise the turtle doesn't change
position).

To fill in spaces, use ``STARTFILL``, move your turtle, and finish
with ``ENDFILL``.  The turtle's path will be turned into a closed
shape (even if the path doesn't close, and may cross itself).

``DISTANCE`` will find the distance to another turtle, or if you
provide it with two arguments (like ``(DISTANCE :t1 :t2)``) will find
the distance between the two given turtles.

``ALLTURTLES`` returns a list of all the turtles.

Multiple turtles are supported in PyLogo.  The "current" turtle is
always stored in the ``:TURTLE`` variable.  When you run a command
like ``FD 10`` you are asking ``:TURTLE`` to do this command.

To create a new turtle, use the ``NEWTURTLE`` command.  This returns a
turtle object, so you will almost always want to do ``MAKE :t
NEWTURTLE`` to save the result.

To control a different turtle, you can use the ``TELL`` command, like
``TELL :t [fd 10]``.  This creates a new scope where ``:TURTLE`` is
bound to ``:t``, then evaluates the block.

Threads and Concurrent Processing
---------------------------------

PyLogo supports multiple threads of processing.  

.. warning::

   Right now PyLogo does not support threads being used with turtles
   -- you can only use turtles from the main thread.  This sucks.  It
   has to do with Tk (which the turtles use) being single-threaded.
   Hopefully we can fix this, because it's these two features together
   that are most fun to use.  (``tkthread`` is my attempt to run
   turtle commands in the main thread, while queuing up requests for
   turtle operations in other threads -- for some reason it didn't
   work, though)

The basic threading function is ``SPAWN``.  It works like::

    ??? SPAWN [REPEAT 10 [PRINT "HI WAIT 1]]

This runs ``[REPEAT 10...]`` in another thread.  It also adds another
scope, so that variables can be set locally to the thread.  A
``:THREADNAME`` variable is set local to the scope as well, which
gives a unique name for the thread.

``SPAWN`` takes an optional argument.  If two arguments are given,
then the second is the code for the thread, and the first argument is
a list that is evaluated in the new scope, but still while in the main
thread.  I can't remember why I put this in, but it seemed really
useful at some point.

``WAIT`` waits the given number of seconds (floats work too, of
course).  Useful if you don't want your thread to go crazy fast.

``SYNC`` can help you time your events, compensating for the speed of
the machine.  When you run ``STARTSYNC`` a special variable is created
locally (``:SyncTimestamp``).  Later calls to ``SYNC :Secs`` will wait
however long is necessary for so that it will be have been at least
``:Secs`` seconds since the last ``SYNC`` or ``STARTSYNC`` command.

Other Functions
---------------

Some other extra functions: 

``ASSERT``, ``ASSERTEQUAL``:
    Just like in Python
``FUNCTION``:
    Returns a function object given the function name.
``CATCH``:
    Works like ``(CATCH [block] "LogoError [except block] ...)``.
    Most exceptions get wrapped in a LogoError exception, so this
    might now work that well yet.
``GETATTR``:
    Like Python's ``getattr``, e.g., ``GETATTR :dict "items`` (returns
    a function object, you'll need to use ``CALL`` to call it)
``SETATTR``:
    Like ``setattr``.
``TIMESTAMP``:
    Returns the timestamp (seconds from the Unix eon).
``CALL``:
    Calls the function object.  Takes optional arguments, which are
    passed to the function.

Using Objects
-------------

Short answer: it's kind of painful.

Right now you have to use things like ``CALL GETATTR :t "FORWARD``.
There's a lot of potential to make this easier, e.g., make ``.`` into
special syntax, like ``CALL :t.forward``, though that isn't enough.

Also, keyword arguments aren't supported, and default arguments are a
bit crude.

Adding Primitives with Python
-----------------------------

You should probably put all your new primitives in a file.
``builtins.py`` and ``logo_turtle.py`` are examples.

Function Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any function defined at the top level of the module will be imported
into the Logo namespace.  You can add function attributes to control
this more closely, however.  Function attributes are added like::

    def func(args):
        ....
    func.attribute = value

Some attributes:

``logoHide``:
    If true, don't import this function.
``logoName``:
    Overrides the name of the function.  E.g., in ``builtins`` I have
    a function ``logoEval`` with ``logoEval.logoName = 'eval'``.  Use
    lower-case names for these.
``aliases``:
    Other names for the function, e.g. ``forward.aliases = ['fd']``.
``arity``:
    Arity is the number of (default) arguments that a function takes.
    Logo will auto-detect the number of arguments, ignoring any
    argument that is given a default value.  If you want to override
    this, use ``arity``.  E.g., ``logoSum.arity = 2``.
``logoAware``:
    If true, the first argument to the function will be the
    interpreter object (and the arity will be adjusted).  This way the
    function can access special Logo features.  See below:

Interpreter Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When making primitives with ``logoAware``, you gain access to the
interpreter object (this is defined in
``pylogo.interpreter.Interpreter`` if you want to look at the
source).  There's a few methods you may wish to use:

``.eval(lst)``:
    Evaluate the list, returning the value of the last expression.
``.getFunction(functionName)``:
    Return the function object.  You should use ``apply`` to run it.
``.setFunction(functionName, func)``:
    Add the function to the interpreter.
``.apply(func, args)``:
    Run the function ``func`` with the given ``args`` (a list or
    tuple); mostly this just uses the ``logoAware`` rule.
``.getVariable(var)``:
    Return the value of the variable.  ``pylogo.common.LogoNameError``
    is raised if the variable is not found.
``.setVariable(var, value)``:
    Set the variable.
``.setVariableLocal(var, value)``:
    Set the variable in the local scope (``setVariable`` will find the
    first scope where the variable is defined, and only if the
    variable is not found in any parent scope will it set it locally).
``.new()``:
    Create a new scope (which is attached to a new interpreter
    object).  This is how you create a local scope.
``.functionNames()``:
    Return a list of function names.
``.variableNames()``:
    Return a list of variable names.

Other Logos
===========

For reference, here are some other free logo implementations:

* `Logo Foundation`_: a good place to start looking at Logo and
  learning about Logo.
* UCBLogo_, intended as a lowest-common-denominator of Logos, it's a
  straight forward, pure, and fairly complete implementation of Logo.
  PyLogo was written with UCBLogo's dialect in mind.
* MSWLogo_, Windows version of UCBLogo.
* ProLOGO_, written in Prolog
* `Turtle Tracks`_: Java implementation of Logo, also based on the
  UCBLogo dialect.
* Boxer_: an academic Logo, with novel ideas of program representation
  and IDE.  I personally find this language very interesting, and
  would love to see some of its ideas in PyLogo, or even better in
  Python itself.  The actual project seems to be inactive.
* StarLogo_: an academic highly concurrent Logo programming (lots of
  independent turtles acting simultaneously)
* StarLogoT_: an academic Logo language with an emphasis on
  concurrency and parallelism.  Seems like a more active offshoot of
  StarLogo.
* NetLogo_: an academic Logo language oriented on concurrency and
  independent agents.  Related to StarLogoT. 
* Elica_: an academic OO Logo, with strong graphics capabilities.  
* aUCBLogo_: a fork of UCBLogo.
* `Scheme Logo`_: a Logo interpreter written in Scheme.
* `Logo in Scheme`_: a Logo to Scheme compiler (written by me).
* TinyLogo_: Logo for the Palm.
* rLogo_: Logo that can be distributed in applet form (as a special
  plugin; Turtle Tracks might actually be easier to distribute).
* XLogo_, Mac OS X Logo (incomplete language?)
* `Logo nyelv`_, Hungarian, written in Turbo Pascal, 
* JavaLogo_, appears to be turtle graphics, without the Logo
  language.
* MonoLOGO_: a .NET Logo implementation, seems focused on the language
  more than the graphics at this point.
* SharpLOGO_: C# implementation, I believe just turtle graphics without
  the Logo language.
* Galapago_: Java turtle graphics with an incomplete Logo language,
  focused on Fractals.
* Tortue_, written in Java (incomplete language?)
* `KLogo-Turtle`_: KDE turtle graphics, incomplete Logo language.
* KTurtle_: related to KLogo-Turtle in some way; pretty new.
* `Logo++`_: a C++ Logo-like language (with significant language
  changes)
